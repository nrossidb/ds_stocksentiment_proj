# ds_stocksentiment_proj
Repo for the data science GME stock sentiment analysis project

Going to work on this in phases. Current phase is incredibly simple and just a proof of concept. Several things need to be changed/updated/added to make this a more viable project

1. Currently pulls in a way too limited amount of information. I purposefully set it to pull in  a low number of tweets just to test the functionality and not go crazy with my API usage.
2. I need to pull tweets over a specified time period. My goal is to observe the sentiment during key periods of time like before, during, and after earnings reports. It currently only pulls in several recent tweets and measures sentiment.
3. I need to pull in financial information for the stock and compare sentiment to stock performance over a specific timeframe. Need to pick which API to use and set up visualization
